# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-For-Sustainable-Agriculture
# OVERVIEW
 Plant Disease Detection is one of the mind boggling issue that exits when we talk about using Technology in Agriculture.Although researches has been done to detect weather a plant is healthy or diseased using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network, new techniques are still being discovered.

Here is my approach for Detecting weather a plant leaf is healthy or unhealthy by utilising classical Machine Learning Algorithm , Pre-processing the data using ImageÂ Processing
